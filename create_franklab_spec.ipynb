    "## Create the specification for the Frank Lab NWB extension\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurately representing the context of an experiment is essential for interpreting behavioral and neural data. The primary purpose of the Frank Lab extension is to represent experimental apparatuses in which our animals perform experiments (i.e. tracks, mazes, sleep boxes, open field arenas). We also provide an extension to represent the behavioral tasks that our animals are performing (i.e. free exploration, W-alternation, sleep).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook creates the blueprint for what a Frank Lab extension must look like.  However, it does not actually implement the extension in Python or Matlab for you to use with your data. Think of building a house; you need the blueprints before you actually build the house.  This notebook is for creating those blueprints, which we call NWB specifications. The NWB specifications will be saved as a pair of YAML (.yaml) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For overview documentation on extensions in PyNWB, see the [Extensions Short Tutorial](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/general/extensions.html) and [Extensions Long Tutorial](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html#extending-nwb). Those tutorials give a basic overview, but the nitty-gritty of working with NWB Extensions is best understood through examples. We therefore recommend reading the documentation and comments in this notebook and in fl_extension.py."

We primarily use the [NWBGroupSpec](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pynwb.spec.html#pynwb.spec.NWBGroupSpec) class to help us create valid NWB groups. An NWB group is basically just a container that can have things like a name, attributes, and data. Like the walls in a house, groups often form the outline of an extension. In fl_extension.py (where we implement this extension in Python), each of these groups will get its own Python class.\n",

An NWB attribute is just what it sounds like: a short piece of metadata defining some attribute, such as a \"help\" text. An NWB dataset is also pretty self-explanatory: it's just some data (numbers, text, etc.).  In structuring our blueprint, we often put attributes and datasets inside a group, like putting lights and appliances in a room of a house."
