    "## Create the specification for the Frank Lab NWB extension\n",
    "\n",
    "NWB provides many basic datatypes, but we also need to represent lab-specific information. NWB includes an 'extension' mechanism that allows labs to specify their own data types and store them in valid NWB files. Extensions can also be shared across groups working with similar types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For overview documentation on extensions in PyNWB, see the [Extensions Short Tutorial](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/general/extensions.html) and [Extensions Long Tutorial](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html#extending-nwb). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we demonstrate the use of NWB Extensions through example. We recommend reading this notebook and fl_extension.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the Frank Lab extension includes data types for apparatuses in which our animals perform experiments (i.e. tracks, mazes, sleep boxes, open field arenas), and tasks that our animals are performing on those apparatuses (i.e. free exploration, W-alternation, sleep).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this notebook will generate two YAML (.yaml) files at the locations defined in the 'ns_path' and 'ext_path' variables below. If you wanted to, you could just write these .yaml files by hand, following conventions in the [NWB Specification Language](https://schema-language.readthedocs.io/). But this would be very cumbersome! Thankfully the PyNWB API includes a number of helper functions to allow you to create these files programmatically, which is what we will demonstrate here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you need only run these commands once, to create the specification (or 'spec' for short) for your extensions (i.e. the two .yaml files). These .yaml files are the actual definition of your extension (you can think of the spec files as the 'blueprints') and these will be read and parsed by your NWB API (PyNWB or MatNWB). Note that this same specification language is also used to define all the core data types and structure of an NWB file!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook creates the spec for our extension. However, it does not actually implement the extension in Python or Matlab for you to use with your data. Ideally, the PyNWB or MatNWB API would automatically be able to use this specification to read and write data using the data types defined in our extension. Currently, however, there is still a little manual work needed to support this. This code is provided in fl_extension.py, which should be imported when you want to work with this extension."

An NWB group is basically just a container that can have things like a name, attributes, datasets, and even nested groups. In fl_extension.py (where we implement this extension in Python), each of these groups will get its own Python class.\n",

    "We add items within a group using [NWBAttributeSpec]() and [NWBDatasetSpec](). An NWB attribute is just what it sounds like: a short piece of metadata defining some attribute, such as a \"help\" text.
